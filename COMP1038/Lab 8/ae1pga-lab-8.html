	  <h2>Expanding Integer List</h2>

	  <p>This task is to create functions to handle single-linked lists. The file with the name <code>int_list.c(incomplete)</code> contains 
the definition of a structure which can hold an integer value and a pointer to the next list structure in the list and a few functions, to 
append, print the list.  Based on the lecture, complete the implementation of such a data-structure with the 
	  following functions.  In each case, think about what different situations you may have (eg, empty vs non-empty list) and how you
	  could handle errors.
	  </p>
	  <p>Textbook Chapter 12 also covers data-structures in C and might be helpful (be careful of the type definitions though.  
	  The book likes to <code>typedef</code> pointer types, which I think is confusing because it can make things that are pointers 
	  look like they are not, and vice-versa).
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	      
	    <li><code>list_prepend</code> that takes a pointer to a pointer to the first element of a list and a new value, and adds that new value to the start of the list.<br>
	      <code>int list_prepend(IntList **start, int newval);</code>
		
	    <li><code>list_insert</code> that takes a pointer to a pointer to the first element of a list, a new value, and an index, and adds that new value before the n'th element of the list.<br>
	      <code>int list_insert(IntList **start, int newval, int index);</code>
	      
	    <li><code>list_get</code> that takes a pointer to the first element of a list and an index, and returns the the value at that index.<br>
	      <code>int list_get(IntList *start, int index);</code>
	      
	    <li><code>list_contains</code> that takes a pointer to the first element of a list and a target value, and returns true or false if the list does or does not contain that value.<br>
	      <code>int list_contains(IntList *start, int target);</code>

	    <li><code>list_remove</code> that takes a pointer to a pointer to the first element of a list and an index, and removes that element at that index from the list.<br>
	      <code>void list_remove(IntList **start, int index);</code>

		  <li><code>list_free</code> that takes a pointer to the first element of a list, and free all allocated memory.<br>
	      <code>void list_free(IntList *start);</code>
		  </ul>
