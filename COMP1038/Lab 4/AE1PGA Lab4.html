	  <h1>AE1PGA Lab 4</h1>



<p>
	    Below are some tasks that will give you an opportunity to practice using the features and concepts we've discussed in the last few lectures. Often these tasks have some unexpected complications, so don't skip them just because they look easy when you read them.

	  <h2>Textbook 6.13 (Identifying the errors)</h2>
	  <p>
	    There are 1 or more errors in each part.  We'll go over them at half-time.
	    If you can't work it out by looking at it, create a small program to replicate that line of code and see what the compiler tells you.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Textbook 6.15 (Array intersection)</h2>
	  <p>
	    Write a program to work out the intersection of two sets of 10 integers entered by the user.  Don't waste space by having unnecessarily large arrays but don't worry about working out the smallest theoretical array size to use.
	  </p>

	  
	  <h2>Sorting algorithms: Bubble sort and Selection sort </h2>
	  <p>
	    Write two programs to implement bubble sort and selection sort respectively. The programs should sort the array of integers entered by the user.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Lecture slides: 2D text canvas</h2>
	  <p>
	    We could have a 2D array of chars that represents the characters we want to show on the screen.  We could then "draw" things into that array by changing the char values at different elements in the array.  We could then "display" that array by printing each of the characters out to fill up the screen.  Try implementing this idea and play around with drawing to the array then using printf to print the entire array.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Exercise: Array operation</h2>
	  <p>
	    Write a program that allows the user to enter several numbers into an array and print out the even-valued numbers.</p>
 <p>
The program should start by asking the user to enter how many numbers they are going to input, using the prompt "Enter number of values: ". This input must be an integer greater than zero. If it is not greater than zero then the program should print the error message "Invalid array length!" and then prompt "Enter a positive number: " and keep reading values until a positive number is entered. The program should create an int array of that length.</p>
 <p>
Next, the program should prompt the user to enter a number for each position in the array, starting from position 0, using the prompt "Enter position XX value: " (where XX is the zero-based index position in the array that the number will be stored in). The number must be an int value bigger than the first entered number in the array. If the number is not valid, the program should repeatedly prompt the user to enter the number for the same position again, using the message above, until it is valid.</p>
 <p>
Once all the numbers have been entered, the program should print all the even numbers in the array, 1 per line. The numbers should appear in the order they were input. Zero should be regarded as an even number. Finally, the program should print "XXX even numbers and YYY odd numbers." (where XXX and YYY should be the number of evens and odds in the array respectively). Once it is finished, the program should exit.</p>
 <p>
User input should be on the same line as the prompt. Output messages should be printed on a line by themselves. When the program exits the command prompt should not be on the same line as the output message.</p>
<p>
You can assume the user will only enter a single whole number at each prompt (ie, no text, no floating-point numbers, no multiple numbers, no empty input, etc).</p>
